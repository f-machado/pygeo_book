## Características

Python is a [high-level language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language)
suitable for rapid development.

It has a relatively small core language supported by many libraries.

Multiple programming styles are supported (procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc.)

Python is interpreted rather than compiled.

### Sintaxis y diseño

One nice feature of Python is its elegant syntax --- we\'ll see many
examples later on.

Elegant code might sound superfluous but in fact it\'s highly beneficial
because it makes the syntax easy to read and easy to remember.

Remembering how to read from files, sort dictionaries and other such
routine tasks means that you don\'t need to break your flow in order to
hunt down correct syntax.

Closely related to elegant syntax is an elegant design.

Features like iterators, generators, decorators and list comprehensions
make Python highly expressive, allowing you to get more done with less
code.

[Namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace) improve
productivity by cutting down on bugs and syntax errors.

### Programación científica

Python has become one of the core languages of scientific computing.

It\'s either the dominant player or a major player in

-   [machine learning and data science](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
-   [astronomy](http://www.astropy.org/)
-   [artificial intelligence](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonForArtificialIntelligence)
-   [chemistry](http://chemlab.github.io/chemlab/)
-   [computational biology](http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page)
-   [meteorology](https://pypi.org/project/meteorology/)

Its popularity in economics is also beginning to rise.
